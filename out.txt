   So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
   So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st:
Nor shall death brag thou wander’st in his shade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
By chance or nature’s changing course untrimm'd;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date;
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
